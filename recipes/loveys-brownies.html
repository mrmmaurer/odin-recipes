        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Bake the most delicious brownies ever with this recipe upgraded by Sharon Cottrel! Original recipe from <em>Food and Wine</em> March 1990</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 sticks (8 oz.) unsalted butter</li>
                <li>6 oz. unsweetened chocolate, coarsely chopped</li>
                <li>2 c. sugar</li>
                <li>4 eggs, room temperature</li>
                <li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp. salt</li>
                <li>1 generous cup coarsely chopped walnuts or pecans (about 3 oz.)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>    
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a 13 x 9 x 2 inch metal pan with foil; lightly grease or spray with Pam.</li>
                <li>In a large saucepan, heat the butter over moderately low heat until half melted. Add the chocolate and stir until the chocolate and butter are completely melted and combined. Remove frome the heat and stir in the sugar with a wooden spoon until incorporated.</li>
                <li>Using the wooden spoon, beat in the eggs, one at the time, stirring after each addition until the eggs are fully incorporated and the chocolate mixture is shiny. Stir in the vanilla. Add the flour and salt all at once and mix until blended. Carefully distribute the nuts on top of the batter - they are crunchier when baked on top of the brownies.</li>
                <li>Scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the brownies are slightly firm to the touch and they start to pull away from the side of the pan. Let cool completely in the pan. Cut into 35 bars.</li>
            </ol>
